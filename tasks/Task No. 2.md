# **✅ Task: Contact Book CLI with Persistence & Tests**

  

### **🎯 Objective**

  

Apply Python fundamentals (variables, lists, dicts, classes, functions, file handling, exceptions, testing) to build a functional **Contact Book CLI app**.

---

### **🧠 Requirements**

  

Build a CLI app that allows the user to:

- ➕ Add a new contact (name, phone, email)
    
- 📃 List all contacts
    
- 🔍 Search for a contact by name
    
- 📝 Update a contact
    
- ❌ Delete a contact
    

  

Store the contacts in a JSON file (contacts.json) for persistence.

---

### **🔧 Tech Requirements**

- Organize code using **classes** (e.g., Contact, ContactBook)
    
- Handle invalid input with **try/except**
    
- Use **argparse** or a simple menu loop with input()
    
- Write at least **3 unit tests** (e.g., adding contact, searching contact, deleting contact) using unittest or pytest
    
- Split into multiple files (e.g., main.py, models.py, utils.py, tests/)
