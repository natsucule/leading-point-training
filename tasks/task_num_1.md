# âœ… Week 1 Task: Python CLI Todo App with Git Workflow

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Practice Python basics and Git version control through building a simple command-line tool.

---

## ðŸ§  Requirements

Build a Python CLI app that lets the user:
- Add a todo item  
- List all items  
- Mark items as done  
- Delete items  

Use a local file (e.g., `todos.json` or `.txt`) to store the data persistently.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Requirements

- Use functions and basic error handling  
- Structure code into at least two files: `main.py`, `utils.py`  
- Use `argparse` or basic `input()` for interaction  
- Use Git for version control: at least **5 meaningful commits**

---

## ðŸ“¦ Deliverables

- Project in GitHub repo with a `README.md` including:
  - How to run the app
  - Features
  - **Bonus:** Add `--help` using `argparse`
